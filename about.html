            <h2>Matthews Century Farms</h2>
            <p>My family lives on a century-old farm which has been converted into a wedding venue. While my parents and grandparents have handled most of the interpersonal affairs of the business, I have been around to assist in setting up ceremonies and maintaining the property structures and the property landscape.</p>
        
            <h2>Pie Five</h2>
            <p>During my senior year of high school, I worked at a pizza restaurant called Pie Five. I devoted much of my time after school and on the weekends to serving customers, and to closing down the restaurant after closing.</p>
        
            <h2>Geneos</h2>
            During the entirety of my college career, I have worked part-time at another pizza place called Geneos Pizza and Pub. There I've been entrusted not only with cooking food for the customers, but have also been tasked with closing the establishment after hours and being in charge of other employees in the managers' absence.

        <h1>Interests</h1>
            <h2>Writing</h2>
                <p>Writing as a hobby is something I've had an interest in ever since middle school. However, it wasn't until I graduated high school and began enrolling in college that I realized my passion for writing could be a potential avenue for my career. While my interest in writing has, for the most part, been grounded in fictional storytelling, I have been told by teachers and professors that I'm skilled in academic writing as well.</p>
        
            <h2>Film and Television</h2>
                <p>I have always held a great interest in visual media such as film and television. While I of course enjoy them as entertainment, I also enjoy speculating on them and analyzing the writing of the stories in media.</p>
            
            <h2>Video Editing</h2>
                <p>Online media has also been a big part of my life, specifically online videos from platforms like YouTube. As a result, I've developed an interest in creating my own videos, both for the purpose of entertainment and as an outlet for my creative skills.</p>
